# miniPokedex
This is a web site with pokedex theme created by me with the objective of training flexbox positioning.

If you change the screen size the content in <main> will rearrange itself to fit the screen and the <header> and <footer> will eventually change it's flex position
  from row to column in order to also fit the screen. 
  
  In this project I also learned a few new things like using a custom font, making the background image fixed so that it does not repeat itself vertically,
  using different CSS styling according to screen size... 
  
  If you have any suggestions to improve my project or ways I could have done it better, please, feel free to get in touch. I would love to hear your thoughts.
